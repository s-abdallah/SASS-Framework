Summary of how to configure and use the Web Framework



# Web Framework
###### Current version: 2.0.0


### Getting Started
Please be reminded that this is NOT a fully functional site. Instead, it serves as the foundational framework that developers use for all of their custom-built websites. In order to achieve operational functionality, You will first need to clone the current release from github.com/s-abdallah/SASS-Framework to a local project folder and prepare the project per the SOP.  Once you have the folder and project set up and working, there are a few things that you will need to configure to get the site working:

* __PRECOMP
	* SASS - you will need to set the name of the main project css file from app.scss

### Grunt / Precomp Process Notes
The web framework package includes the developers' Grunt script, enabling straightforward file minification and uglification throughout the development process and up to the release phase. To utilize this feature, please follow these steps:
- Navigate to the root folder containing the gruntfile.js script using your terminal application or the ULT-Terminal package within Atom.
- Once you've reached the appropriate directory, type `grunt dev` in the terminal to display a list of available tools and options.

Your cooperation in adhering to these steps is greatly appreciated. Should you require any further assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out.
